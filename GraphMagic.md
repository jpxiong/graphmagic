# Introduction #

GraphMagic is a cross-platform open-source pluginable desktop application for working with graph models and algorithms.


# Vision and Scope #

The GraphMagic is for scientists and students working with graph models and algorithms. They should be able to easily create graphs, see and modify their visual representations, and apply algorithms on them. This falls to the following requirements:
  * Should support the most used operational systems for personal computers with graphical user interface. At least Linux, MS Windows, and MacOS should be supported.
  * Should support pluggable algorithms: any user should be able to add his own algorithm or some functionality in his working context, as long as propose the algorithm for inclusion to a basic package to share the algorithm or functionality with other users.
  * Users should be able to save and share their built graphs with visual representations.
